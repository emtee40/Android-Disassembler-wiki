== Introduction ==
Android-Disassembler is an android app that can disassemble any binaries on mobile phones. This applicatiin is based on the *Capstone disassembler project.* I started developing this for myself, but with your interests and supports I upgraded this program continuously, now it being ver 1.3.1.
 This is a freeware and anybody can use this app.
 I am targetting this app to be something like OllyDbg or IDA on mobile platform.

== Usage ==

=== Choose the target ===
As expected, the first thing to do is to choose a target file to disassemble.
I am expecting to add "Analyzing live process" feature in the future.

=== See details ===
You can see some basic information about the target file in the first tab, and some advanced information in the second tab(the advanced information is currently available only for elf files)

=== See symbols ===

=== Disassemble! ===
